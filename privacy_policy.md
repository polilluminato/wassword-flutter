## Introduction

Welcome to Wassword! We believe in strong security and complete transparency. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains how Wassword operates.

## Data Collection

**Wassword does not collect any personal data.**<br>
Our mission with Wassword is to provide a simple, powerful, and secure tool for password generation without compromising your privacy. Collecting data would go against this fundamental principle. We believe that true security comes from minimizing data exposure.

- No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
- All password generation happens **entirely offline**, on your device.
- No analytics, tracking, or monitoring tools are used.
- We do not use cookies or similar technologies.

## Data Sharing

**Wassword does not share any data with third parties.**<br>
Because Wassword does not collect any data, there is no data to share with any third parties, organizations, or companies.

## Permissions

Wassword does not request or require any device permissions that would access personal or sensitive user data.

## Security

While Wassword does not process or store personal data, it is built with privacy and security as core principles:

- Passwords generated by Wassword are ephemeral. They are displayed to you for immediate use and are not stored, logged, or saved within the app. It's your responsibility to securely store any generated passwords you wish to keep.
- The app is open source, so anyone can audit the code to verify its safety and transparency.

## Open Source
